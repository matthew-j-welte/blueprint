# Muscle to Body Model Muscle Location Mapping Component (Design)

## Description

This component accepts a list of muscles (by string) and efficiently displays that muscle on a model of the human body. We need to be able to update this quickly without using too much CPU and with it being obvious and accurate.

This component should have 3 modes:

- Front
- Back
- Both
