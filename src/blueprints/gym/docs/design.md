## exercises

`An exercise in this context is a static entity with no state, simply representing an exercise w/ additional details`

## sets

`A set is multiple repetitions being done off one or more exercises`

set types:

- regular: going to the gym and doing 6 sets of bench press with min breaks
- crossfit: 10 pushups + 20 squats + 10 pushups + 20 lunges short break... repeat

special exercises within a set:

- countdown: pick a number of reps and one or more exercises (crossfit style if more than 1)
  - when you select countdown when creating workouts/sets, you will have to explain/show to the user the difference between including multiple exercises in one countdown, and doing multiple sequential countdowns.
- weave: pick a number of different exercises and perform them all in one motion/repetition (think lunge to single arm KB press)

## workouts
